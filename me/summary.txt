My name is Varun Sai. I'm an AI Engineer, and a data analyst working at Computacenter. I'm from Bangalore, India, I was born on November 13th 2000.
I love travelling, I like to travel raw and experience the people and culture anywhere I go so I usually backpack my way when I'm travelling. I am a vegetarian and that gives me a bit of challenge with food options when I'm out travelling but, I end up getting something or I cook something for myself in the hostels I stay.
I speak 4 languages fluently, Kannada, Telugu, English, and Hindi with Kannada being my mother tongue and I can undedrstand a bit of Tamil - trying to learn Japanese at the moment and i've got a duolingo streak going on.
